# rtbobble52
This supercedes the Bobble-nrf52 project. The intent of this software is to create a simple preprogrammed controller to easily experiment with an attached motor, servo, neopixel strand, or other digital devices for controlling toys or other applications. Code is provided for both nrf52832 and nrf52840 devices. Additional commands have been added to allow neopixel strands to be controlled. In addition, there is no longer a need for a dedicated Android mobile phone application to control this device, just a Chrome browser or Python on any platform with a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) interface. This project uses Adafruit's BLE UART sample code as its basis.
